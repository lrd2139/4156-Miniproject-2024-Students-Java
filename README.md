Dear 4156 Staff,

There were a number of vital setup errors that neither I nor several of the TAs were able to resolve.  They were as follows:

1. The command â€œmvn checkstyle:check" would not run in my terminal, and thus I could not see the stylistic issues that I created or that needed to be fixed from the get-go.

2. Running the test cases did not generate the target/site/jacoco directory.  Therefore, I could not see any code coverage analysis whatsoever, and simply had to hope that the percentage of code coverage was enough for this project.

During the majority of this project, I was programming with the main intent to create as many test cases and solve as many bugs as I could, all while being disadvantaged with regard to restricted functionality.  I would be extremely grateful if these factors were taken into consideration during the grading of this assignment, as I truly tried to do the best I could with the limited abilities (and limited time due to being unable to progress further).  Thank you all so much in advance. :)

Best,
Larry Davis
